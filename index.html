          <h3>Prehistoric times</h3>
          <p>
            Before the advent of HTML5, we had limited control over browser
            history we were not able to control and manipulate the session
            history of a particular browsing context. We could go back and forth
            using the available methods, but that was not without incurring page
            reloads or relying on <code>location.hash</code> workarounds. With
            the HTML5 History API, we have more control with the browser
            history. For example, we have a way to add an entry in the history,
            or change the URL in the address bar without refreshing the page.
          </p>

          <h3>Browser Support</h3>
          <p>Browser support for the HTML5 History API is quite good.</p>

          <h3>Why A History API?</h3>
          <p>
            If you like building apps without heavy frameworks or routing
            libraries, this one’s for you.
          </p>
          <p>
            It allows us to build applications in an SEO-friendly manner.
            Furthermore, this technique allows us to reduce bandwidth. That
            means we will load all required resources on the first page load.
            From there onward, the application will download only the required
            contents. In other words, instead of loading all resources all the
            time, it will load only required resources from a second content
            request. Note that you need to perform some server-side coding to
            deliver only partial resources instead of full page content.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>
            Another reason to use this API is because users love the browser’s
            back button.
          </p>
          <p>
            It even

              won an award</a
            >
            as the most pressed button in Firefox back in the day. So your app
            should definitely 100% expect that users will try to use the back
            button everywhere in your app to return to previous views.

          <h3>Basic concepts and syntax</h3>
          <p>
            The History API relies on a single DOM interface — the
            <b>History</b> object. There is a unique <b>History</b> object
            defined for each tab, accessed through the <b>history</b> attribute
            of the Window interface. This can be manipulated using JavaScript
            along with some special methods. To relate this to the actual pages
            in your session <b>history</b>, each Document object is associated
            with a unique instance of the tab's <b>History</b> object (they all
            model the same underlying session <b>history</b>).
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>
            <b>History</b> objects represent each tab's session
            <b>history</b> as a flat, comma-separated list of session
            <b>history</b> entries. Each session <b>history</b> entry consists
            of a URL or a state object (or both), and in addition can have a
            title, a Document object, form data, a scroll position, and other
            information associated with it.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>The basic methods of the history object are:</h3>
          <code>
            <ul>
              <li>
                window.history.length
              </li>
              <li>window.history.state</li>
              <li>
                window.history.go(n)
              </li>
              <li>
                window.history.back()
              </li>
              <li>
                window.history.forward()
              </li>
              <li>
                window.history.pushState(data, title [, url])
              </li>
              <li>
                window.history.replaceState(data, title [, url])
              </li>
            </ul></code
          >
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>View as a function of state</h3>
          <p>
            The History API assumes that your view is a function of state — that
            is, what is displayed on screen depends on a global state object.
            This allows the browser to store all your states so that when a user
            presses the back button, they return to the previous state as
            expected.
          </p>
          <p>
            So to use the History API, you must have a global state of some kind
            that your views depend on.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>
            The flow looks like this:
          </p>
          <p>
            user event -> update state -> re-render
          </p>
          <p>
            Every action should trigger a state change, which triggers a
            re-render.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Manipulating History</h3>
          <p>
            To use the browser’s history functionality, you begin by telling the
            browser to remember your initial state. This requires the
            replaceState method like so:
          </p>
          <code> window.history.replaceState(state, null, "")</code>
          <p>
            If you want to change URL be sure to update your server side code to
            handle the path
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>
            Whenever the user does something that updates state, such as
            clicking a checkbox or navigating to a different view, you will need
            to update your state and then store it in the browser. After
            updating your state, call this:
          </p>
          <code>window.history.pushState(state, null, "")</code>
          <p>
            With every push, the browser gathers more and more states that it
            can cycle through if the user wants to start cycling back.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>
            The browser’s back button triggers the onpopstate listener, which
            connects to the History API
          </p>
          <code>
            <p>window.onpopstate = function (event) {</p>
            <p>if (event.state) {</p>
            <p>state = event.state;</p>
            <p>}</p>
            <p>render(state);</p>
            <p>};</p>
          </code>
          <p>
            Event has a property state that has old state. Just set your
            application state to this old state and trigger a re-render to
            display the old state
          </p>

          <h3>Summary</h3>
          <p>
            Now we have some understanding of the History interface. We used
            pushState to add entries to the browsing context's history and the
            popstate event to react to state changes. What's more, each file
            that has been navigated to can be accessed later at its real URL.
            This highlights the real usefulness of the history API: you can
            create Ajaxy navigation in the style of Facebook or Twitter, without
            breaking the back button or the URLs to individual pages. Although
            bear in mind that hashbangs don't work if you share the URL with
            someone who has scripting disabled.
